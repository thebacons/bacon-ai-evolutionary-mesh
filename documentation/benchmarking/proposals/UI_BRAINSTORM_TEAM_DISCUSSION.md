# Internal Team Brainstorm: BACON-AI "Radiance" UI

**Topic:** Improving the Intelligence Mesh Visualization
**Participants:** Systems Architect, UI/UX Designer, Intelligence Engineer (Simulated)

## 1. The "Systems Architect" Perspective
> *Focus: Performance, Data Integrity, State Management*

- **Binary States vs. Analog Attention**: "Online/Offline" is too simple. We should visualize the "Attention Buffer." If an agent is processing a large prompt, its node size should fluctuate (breathing effect) to show CPU/Memory pressure.
- **WebSocket Throttling**: The UI should not 1:1 map every MQTT message if traffic is high. We need "Visual Aggregation"—bursts of messages become a single "thick pulse" to save CPU.
- **Persistence Visuals**: When an agent goes offline, its ghost (wireframe) should stay in place for 60 seconds with a "Last Seen" timestamp, preventing the mesh from jumping around constantly.

## 2. The "UI/UX Designer" Perspective
> *Focus: Branded Aesthetics, Interaction, Flow*

- **The "Clean" Paradox**: "Shiftr is clean because it uses high contrast. We can achieve this in Dark Mode by using high-saturation neon links against a matte black background."
- **Typography as UI**: "Instead of boxes, use floating labels with 0.8 opacity. Only show labels on hover to keep the mesh 'clean' when zoomed out."
- **The "Center of Mass"**: "The Control Plane should be a fixed, unique node (perhaps a hexagonal iris) that stays at the center. All agents naturally gravitate toward it, giving the user a sense of 'Home'."

## 3. The "Intelligence Engineer" Perspective
> *Focus: Mem0 Integration, Agent Synergy, Semantic Visualization*

- **Semantic Regions**: "If three agents are all working on the 'physics-engine' topic, the space between them should be shaded with a faint color (e.g., a blue nebula). This shows 'Logical Clustering' at a glance."
- **Memory "Wisps"**: "When a memory is recorded in Mem0, a small glowing particle should fly from the agent to the Central Core. If the user clicks that particle, it shows the 'Fact' that was learned."
- **The "Wake-up" Sequence**: "When an agent is woken via TMUX, it should show a 'Booting' animation—a circle filling up—before the node fully illuminates."

## 4. Synthesis: Key Design Decisions for Phase 3

| Feature | Design Choice | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Links** | Bioluminescent flowing paths | Superior to static lines; shows traffic direction. |
| **Agent State** | Solid (Active) → Wireframe (Sleeping) → Fade (Offline) | Preserves spatial memory while showing connectivity. |
| **Memory** | Moving particles → Hub | Visualizes the learning process in real-time. |
| **Interactivity** | Circular Context HUD | Fast access to Wake/Signal/terminal without leaving the chart. |
| **Branding** | Neon Hubs / Dark Matte | Feels like an "Intelligence Engine," not a "System Monitor." |
