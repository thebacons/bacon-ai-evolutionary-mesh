# BACON-AI: Evolutionary Mesh
## The Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Ecosystem

Welcome to the **BACON-AI Evolutionary Mesh**, a commercial-grade, MQTT-based multi-agent collaboration framework. 

### ?? Vision
A self-annealing, self-evolving system where distributed agents collaborate across physical boundaries. The system doesn't just execute tasks; it learns from usage, fixes its own errors (via **The Mechanic**), researches the cutting edge (via **The Scout**), and optimizes its own architecture (via **The Architect**).

### ??? Architecture
- **Control Plane**: Centralized \ Brain\ (FastAPI + SQLModel + Mem0).
- **Agent Mesh**: Cross-platform Python daemons (Windows, Linux, IoT).
- **Communication**: Authenticated MQTT (Mosquitto) with Signal Protocol v1.2.
- **Visuals**: Real-time Node-Link graph inspired by \shiftr.io\.

### ?? Directory Structure
- documentation/: Detailed Technical, Functional, and Process designs.
- src/control_plane/: Core orchestration logic and registry.
- src/agent_daemon/: OS-agnostic agent code.
